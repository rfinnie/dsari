.SH NAME
.PP
dsari\-daemon \- dsari scheduling daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
dsari\-daemon [\f[I]options\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]dsari\-daemon\f[R] is a scheduling daemon.
It reads a configuration file containing job information, and schedules
runs of the jobs.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \[en]config\-dir=\f[I]directory\f[R], \-c \f[I]directory\f[R]
Base configuration directory.
Files named \f[C]dsari.yaml\f[R] and/or \f[C]dsari.json\f[R] are
expected in this directory.
.TP
.B \[en]fork
Fork into the background after starting.
.TP
.B \[en]debug
Print extra debugging information while running.
.TP
.B \[en]no\-timestamp
Do not show timestamps in logging output (for process supervisors which
add their own timestamps).
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B \f[I]SIGINT\f[R] (\[ha]C), \f[I]SIGTERM\f[R]
Begin shutdown of the daemon.
By default, all scheduled runs will be cancelled, and any runs in
progress will be left to complete naturally.
The \f[C]shutdown_kill_runs\f[R] configuration option changes this
behavior.
.TP
.B \f[I]SIGHUP\f[R]
Reload the configuration.
If a job\[cq]s configuration changes while a run is in progress, its
changes will take effect once the run is complete.
.TP
.B \f[I]SIGQUIT\f[R] (\[ha]\[rs]\[rs])
Outputs the current status of the \f[C]dsari\-daemon\f[R] process,
including which jobs have runs in progress, and when the jobs\[cq] next
runs are scheduled for.
